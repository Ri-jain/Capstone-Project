#  Skandia Elevator – Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction

 Region: Europe-Sweden (B2B Manufacturing – Grain Equipment)  
 Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter, Excel  
 Affiliation: Northeastern University | Spring 2025  
 Focus: Churn Modeling · RFM Segmentation · Retention Analytics · Revenue Risk

---
## Project Overview

This project applies behavioral segmentation and predictive modeling to Skandia Elevator’s customer order data. The goal is to identify which accounts are most valuable, which are at risk of churn, and how Skandia can proactively retain customers without relying on marketing attribution. Using transaction records from 2013–2025, the analysis produces a data-driven prioritization framework to guide retention strategy.

##  Key Highlights

- Analyzed 130K+ order records linked to 3,000+ customer accounts  
- Built RFM segmentation using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores  
- Labeled churn risk based on time since last order  
- Developed customer prioritization framework combining revenue and churn  
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models  
- Random Forest achieved 99% accuracy in churn prediction  
- Quantified that $9B+ in revenue came from churned accounts

##  Analysis & Results

### RFM Segmentation  
- Assigned 1–4 scores to Recency, Frequency, Monetary metrics  
- Segment labels: Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Inactive  
- Created engagement status: Engaged vs Inactive

### Churn Labeling  
- Snapshot date: max(OrderDate) + 1 day  
- Churn criteria:  
  - Active: ≤ 180 days  
  - Dormant: 181–730 days  
  - Churned: > 730 days  
  - Never Ordered: no order record

### Customer Prioritization  
- Top 10% revenue = High Value  
- Segment Counts:
  - High Value – Retained: 100+ 
  - High Value – At Risk: 70+ 
  - Regular: 200+
  - Low Value – Churned: 1,500+

### Revenue by Churn Category  
- Churned: $9.02B
- Active: $1.98B  
- Dormant: $348M  

### Churn Prediction  
- Features used: total orders, revenue, discount, product diversity, delivery ratio, QC tool usage  
- Models: Logistic Regression (85%), Random Forest (99%)  
- Top churn drivers:  
  - Positive: product diversity, fulfillment rate, order frequency  
  - Negative: heavy discounting, poor delivery

##  Key Learnings

- Majority of revenue came from churned or inactive accounts  
- Product diversity is a strong loyalty indicator  
- Over-discounting is linked to churn behavior  
- Most revenue is concentrated among a very small % of customers  
- Churn is highly predictable using behavioral data alone

---

##  Recommendations

- Prioritize outreach to 68 High Value – At Risk accounts  
- Use RFM and churn scores inside CRM or dashboards  
- Reduce use of aggressive discounting on high-value customers  
- Introduce loyalty-building nudges (reorder reminders, cross-sell triggers)  
- Monitor engagement drop-offs in high-frequency buyers proactively

##  Conclusion

Skandia’s customer base follows a strong Pareto pattern—most of its revenue is generated by a small number of clients, many of whom have now churned. This makes churn not just a retention issue, but a revenue protection priority. By segmenting customers using RFM scores, labeling churn based on behavior, and building predictive models, this project lays the foundation for proactive account management and long-term growth.

All insights were drawn exclusively from internal transactional order data. No CRM or third-party enrichment was used, proving that even raw behavior data holds tremendous untapped strategic value.
